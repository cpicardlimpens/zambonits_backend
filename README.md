# Zamboni Touch Street

*Zamboni Touch Street* has been conceived by Accademia di Belli Arti di Bologna (IT).

*Zamboni Touch Street* consists of a multimedia and interactive tour route divided into several stages along the way, proposed in the form of an online website.
The route is designed as a walk along *Via Zamboni* characterized by multi-sensory interaction with the street and its interest points presented through different types of content (audio, video, images, text, etc). These suggestions will guide the visitor to discover the many aspects of the way.
